    Compute the Fast Low-cost Online Semantic Segmentation (FLOSS) for

    Parameters
    ----------
    mp : ndarray
        The first column consists of the matrix profile, the second column
        consists of the matrix profile indices, the third column consists of
        the left matrix profile indices, and the fourth column consists of
        the right matrix profile indices.

    old_data : ndarray
        A 1-D array of old time series data used to generate the matrix
        profile and matrix profile indices found in `mp`. Note that the
        the right matrix profile index is used and the right matrix profile
        is intelligently recomputed on the fly from `old_data` instead of
        using the bidirectional matrix profile.

    add_data : ndarray
        A 1-D array of additional time series data that is likely arriving
        from a stream.

    m : int
        The window size for computing sliding window mass. This is identical
        to the window size used in the matrix profile calculation. For managing
        edge effects, see the `L` parameter.

    L : int
        The subsequence length that is set roughly to be one period length.
        This is likely to be the same value as the window size, `m`, used
        to compute the matrix profile and matrix profile index but it can
        be different since this is only used to manage edge effects
        and has no bearing on any of the IAC or CAC core calculations.

    excl_factor : int
        The multiplying factor for the regime exclusion zone. Note that this
        is unrelated to the `excl_zone` used in to compute the matrix profile.

    n_iter : int
        Number of iterations to average over when determining the parameters for
        the IAC beta distribution

    n_samples : int
        Number of distribution samples to draw during each iteration when
        computing the IAC

    skip : int
        Number of windows to skip before yielding the first CAC. For example, setting
        `skip=49` will skip the first 49 windows, yield the 50th window, skip the
        next 49 windows, yield the 100th window, etc. This is useful for displaying
        FLOSS in an animation.

    custom_iac : np.array
        A custom idealized arc curve (IAC) that will used for correcting the
        arc curve

    Returns
    -------
    cac_out : ndarray
        A corrected arc curve (CAC) updated as a result of ingressing a single
        new data point and egressing a single old data point.

    mp_out : ndarray
        The first column consists of the matrix profile and the second column
        consists of the matrix profile indices. This updated matrix profile and
        matrix profile indices are a result of ingressing a single new data
        point and egressing a single old data point. Note that this array does
        not contain the left and right matrix profile indices.

    idx_out : int
        The total length of all of the aggregated old data and the additional data.

    T : ndarray
        The last `n` data points from the sliding window after concatenating
        `old_data` and `new_data` as a result of ingressing a single new
        data point and egressing a single old data point
