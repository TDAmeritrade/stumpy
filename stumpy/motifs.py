    min_neighbors : int
        The minimum amount of similar matches a subsequence needs to have

        Defaults to `1`. This means, that a subsequence has to have

        The maximum amount of similar matches to be returned. The resulting
        matches are sorted by distance, so a value of `10` means that the

    max_motifs : int
        Maximum number of different motifs to return.

    normalize : bool
        When set to `True`, this z-normalizes subsequences prior to computing distances.
