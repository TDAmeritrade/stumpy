    Timeseries, T_B, will be annotated with the distance location

    Return: For every subsequence, Q, in T_B, you will get a distance
    and index for the closest subsequence in T_A. Thus, the array
    returned will have length T_B.shape[0]-m+1. Additionally, the

    Note: Unlike in the Table II where T_A.shape is expected to be equal

    T_A and T_B can be different. In the case where T_A.shape == T_B.shape,
    then our algorithm reduces down to the same algorithm found in Table II.

    Additionally, unlike STAMP where the exclusion zone is m/2, the default
    exclusion zone for STOMP is m/4 (See Definition 3 and Figure 3).

    For self-joins, set `ignore_trivial = True` in order to avoid the
    trivial match.
