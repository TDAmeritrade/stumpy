    Timeseries, T_A, will be annotated with the distance location
    (or index) of all its subsequences in another times series, T_B.

    Return: For every subsequence, Q, in T_A, you will get a distance
    and index for the closest subsequence in T_B. Thus, the array
    returned will have length T_A.shape[0]-m+1. Additionally, the
    left and right matrix profiles are also returned.

    Note: Unlike in the Table II where T_A.shape is expected to be equal
    to T_B.shape, this implementation is generalized so that the shapes of
    T_A and T_B can be different. In the case where T_A.shape == T_B.shape,
    then our algorithm reduces down to the same algorithm found in Table II.

    Additionally, unlike STAMP where the exclusion zone is m/2, the default
    exclusion zone for STOMP is m/4 (See Definition 3 and Figure 3).

    For self-joins, set `ignore_trivial = True` in order to avoid the
    trivial match.

    Note that left and right matrix profiles are only available for self-joins.

    to T_B.shape, this implementation is generalized so that the shapes of
    T_A and T_B can be different. In the case where T_A.shape == T_B.shape,
    then our algorithm reduces down to the same algorithm found in Table II.

    Additionally, unlike STAMP where the exclusion zone is m/2, the default
    exclusion zone for STOMP is m/4 (See Definition 3 and Figure 3).

    For self-joins, set `ignore_trivial = True` in order to avoid the
    trivial match.

    Note that left and right matrix profiles are only available for self-joins.
