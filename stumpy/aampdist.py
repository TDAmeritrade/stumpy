    Compute the non-normalized (i.e., without z-normalization) matrix profile distance
    measure vector between `Q` and each subsequence, `T[i : i + len(Q)]`, within `T`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Q : numpy.ndarray
        Query array

    T : numpy.ndarray
        Time series or sequence

    m : int
        Window size

    percentage : float, 0.05
        The percentage of distances that will be used to report `mpdist`. The value
        is between 0.0 and 1.0. This parameter is ignored when `k` is not `None` or when
        `k_func` is not None.

    k : int, default None
        Specify the `k`th value in the concatenated matrix profiles to return. When `k`
        is not `None`, then the `percentage` parameter is ignored. This parameter is
        ignored when `custom_func` is not None.

    custom_func : object, default None
        A custom user defined function for selecting the desired value from the
        unsorted `P_ABBA` array. This function may need to leverage `functools.partial`
        and should take `P_ABBA` as its only input parameter and return a single
        `MPdist` value. The `percentage` and `k` parameters are ignored when
        `custom_func` is not None.

    """
    Compute the non-normalized (i.e., without z-normalization) matrix profile distance
    (MPdist) measure between any two time series with `stumpy.aamp`.

    The MPdist distance measure considers two time series to be similar if they share
    many subsequences, regardless of the order of matching subsequences. MPdist
    concatenates the output of an AB-join and a BA-join and returns the `k`th smallest
    value as the reported distance. Note that MPdist is a measure and not a metric.
    Therefore, it does not obey the triangular inequality but the method is highly
    scalable.

    Parameters
    ----------
    T_A : numpy.ndarray
        The first time series or sequence for which to compute the matrix profile

    T_B : numpy.ndarray
        The second time series or sequence for which to compute the matrix profile

    m : int
        Window size

    percentage : float, default 0.05
        The percentage of distances that will be used to report `mpdist`. The value
        is between 0.0 and 1.0.

    k : int
        Specify the `k`th value in the concatenated matrix profiles to return. When `k`
        is not `None`, then the `percentage` parameter is ignored.

    Returns
    -------
    MPdist : float
        The matrix profile distance
