    "You don't need a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account to use STUMPY but you do need an account if you want to make a code or documentation contribution. This GitHub account will allow you to contribute to many of the most popular open source projects. Additionally, it will give you a place to store, track, and coordinate progress on your own projects. GitHub is a `remote repository` for the version control system `git`. `Git` is a tool that tracks changes in projects by constructing a directed acyclic graph (fancy way of allowing us to create `branches`, `revert` changes, and identify `conflicts`). You can use `git` on your local machine but when you want to save your work or collaborate with other team members, you `push` your work to a `remote` repository. In this case, that `remote` will be GitHub.\n",

    "You've decided that you want to contribute but how do you approach a new project and figure out where you can help? This will feel like like trying to jump into a conversation that's been happening for months (or years) and can often be intimidating. If you've used the project before, you'll be more familiar with its structure and API but you probably haven't \"peeked behind the curtain\". The best place to get started is the list of [Issues](https://github.com/TDAmeritrade/stumpy/issues). These are requests/changes/bugs that other people have identified. Feel free to peruse the list to get a feel for all of the ongoing work in the project. Often, maintainers will have a label system to organize the issues. These labels may include things like `documentation` or `enhancement`. For new contributors, many projects have a [good first issue label](https://github.com/TDAmeritrade/stumpy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).\n",

In others, you may just see the initial issue. This is your chance to have a dialogue with the maintainers. If you've found an open issue that interests you and you think you may be able to solve it, feel free to leave a message. Remember that maintainers are people too and at STUMPY, they're excited to help new contributors. Here's an example of a potential message:\n",
    "\n",
    "> First time contributor here! I see that this issue is related to a bug caused by an incorrect variable name. Does that seem right to you? If so, I'd like to take this issue and submit a pull request to fix it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This message does a couple of things. It shows that you've done a little bit of research into the issue (demonstrates respect for the maintainers' time), gets their input (helps you solve the problem), and makes sure they will accept a pull request (saves your time/effort). Remember how you're jumping into an ongoing conversation? Sometimes an issue will become irrelevant or obsolete based on changes happening elsewhere in the package. A quick note like this lets the maintainer know that you're going to work on this issue and confirms that it is still a valuable issue.\n",

In this case, `branch_name` should be replaced with something descriptive about the change that you are making like `change_incorrect_variable` or `document_x`.\n",
    "\n",

    "When working on a new project, there are often going to be dependencies. In order to isolate dependencies between different projects, it's a good practice to use a virtual environment. STUMPY supports both [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) and [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/). After creating and activating either of these virtual environments, any dependencies you install will be isolated (so they don't break anything else on your system).\n",
    "\n",
    "First, install the dependencies using the [From Source Section](https://stumpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#from-source) of the installation instructions. If you are building STUMPY within a conda environment, then you may consider using the `conda.sh` shell script which will automatically assist you in installing all of the required dependencies required for testing. \n",
    "\n",
    "A good check to make sure everything is working 100% is to run the unit tests. For STUMPY, we have scripts to help you do that. You'll run `./setup.sh && ./test.sh`. In some cases, you may notice an uninstallation message for STUMPY but don't worry. This happens if you have had previously installed STUMPY as the `./setup.sh` command first uninstalls any existing version of STUMPY and then it will re-installs it from source (the local, cloned, development version). So, everything should be all set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, you'll see the excellent STUMPY test coverage passing. If things start failing or breaking, then you may have a missing dependency problem. There's nothing worse than finding this out *after* you've made changes.\n",

Clicking that will automatically create your pull request.  Like a commit, make sure to give it a descriptive name. If your change isn't quite working yet, then you can preface your pull request with `[WIP]` which stands for \"Work in Progress.\" In the body of your Pull Request, reference the Issue Number that you're working on.
