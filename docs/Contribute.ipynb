    "You don't need a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account to use STUMPY, but you do if you want to make a code or documentation contribution. This account will enable you to contribute to many of the most popular open source projects. Additionally, it will give you a place to store, track, and coordinate progress on your own projects. GitHub is a `remote repository` for the version control system `git`. `Git` is a tool that tracks changes in projects by constructing a directed acyclic graph (fancy way of allowing us to create `branches`, `revert` changes, and identify `conflicts`). You use `git` on your local machine, but when you want to save your work or collaborate with other team members, you `push` your work to a `remote` repository. In this case, that `remote` will be GitHub.\n",

    "You've decided that you want to contribute, but how do you approach a new project and figure out where you can help? This will feel like like trying to jump into a conversation that's been happening for months (or years) and can often be intimidating. If you've used the project before, you'll be more familiar with its structure and API, but you probably haven't \"peeked behind the curtain\" before. The best place to get started is the list of [Issues](https://github.com/TDAmeritrade/stumpy/issues). These are requests/changes/bugs that other people have identified. Feel free to peruse the list to get a feel for all of the work ongoing in the project. Often, maintainers will have a label system to organize the issues. These labels may include things like `documentation` or `enhancement`. For new contributors, many projects have a [good first issue label](https://github.com/TDAmeritrade/stumpy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).\n",
    "\n",

    "If you click on any issue, you'll see a running history of chats. This serves as the record of thoughts around that specific issue. For some issues, you may see an ongoing conversation. In others, you may just see the initial issue. This is your chance to have a dialogue with the maintainers. If you've found an open issue that interests you and you think you may be able to solve, feel free to leave a message. Remember that maintainers are people too and at STUMPY, they're excited to help new contributors. Here's an example of a potential message:\n",
    "\n",
    "> First time contributor here! I see that this issue is related to a bug caused by a collision in two variable names *here* and *here*. Does that seem right to you? If so, I'd like to take this issue and submit a pull request.\n",
    "\n",
    "This message does a couple of things. It shows that you've done a little bit of research into the issue (demonstrates respect for the maintainers' time), gets their input (helps you solve the problem) and makes sure they will accept a pull request (saves your time/effort). Remember how you're jumping into an ongoing conversation? Sometimes an issue will become irrelevant or obsolete based on changes happening somewhere else in the package. A quick note like this lets the maintainer know that you're going to work on this issue and confirms that it is still a valuable issue.\n",

    "\n",

    "When working on a new project, there are often going to be dependencies. In order to isolate dependencies between different projects, it's a good practice to use a virtual environment. STUMPY supports both [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) and [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/). After creating and activating either of these virtual environments, any dependencies you install will be isolated (so they don't break anything else on your system).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, install the dependencies using the [From Source Section](https://stumpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#from-source) of the instructions. A good check to make sure everything is working 100% is to run the unit tests. For STUMPY, we have scripts to help you do that. You'll run `./setup.sh && ./test.sh`. Ideally, you'll see the excellent STUMPY test coverage passing. If things start failing or breaking, you have a dependency problem. There's nothing worse than finding this out *after* you've made changes.\n",

If you navigate to your fork of the repository shortly after you push a commit, you'll often see a message like \"Your recently pushed branches: X  <Compare & Pull Request>\". Clicking that will automatically create your pull request.  Like a commit, make sure to give it a descriptive name. If your change isn't quite working yet, you can preface your pull request with `[WIP]` which stands for \"Work in Progress.\" In the body of your Pull Request, reference the Issue Number that you're working on.
