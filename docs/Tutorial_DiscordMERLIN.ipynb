    "### Idea (1): Elimination Approach\n",
    "The idea can be explained as follows: Suppose we are told that the discord distance (`discord_dist`) of length `L` is at least `min_dist` (**NOTE:** In the second Idea, we will explain how to set the `min_dist` value). That means the distance between the discord and each one of its neighbors is at least min_dist. We start scanning the subsequences. If, for a subsequence S, we realize that it has a neighbor to which its distance is smaller than `min_dist`, we can say S cannot be the discord. We just eliminated one candidate! \n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is to eliminate all subsequences for which there exist at least one neighbor with pair-wise distance less than `min_dist`. Therefore, the remaining subsequences (i.e. candidates) are the ones that have a distance great than/equal to `min_dist`. Now, we can find the `NN` of each candidate and choose the discord as the one that has the greatest distance to its `NN`. \n",
    "\n",
    "-------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to have small amount of candidates after the elimination process. This is where choosing a good value for `min_dist` becomes important. For instance, let us consider two very extreme scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario (I): Choosing a very small value `min_dist = 1e-100`. In this case, we are most likly ended up with almost all subsequnces as the candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario (II): Choosing a very large value `min_dist = 1e+100`. In this case, we are most likely ended up with no candidates at all. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the second idea below, we explain how MERLIN chooses the value for `min_dist`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Idea (2): Choosing `min_dist`\n",
    "Let us assume we already discovered the discord `d` of length `L` whose distance to its NN (`d_NN`) is `discord_dist`. Now, to find the discord of length `L+1`, we can set `min_dist = discord_dist`. Because we are increasing the length of subsequences by one, we can say their distance to their neighbors are larger compared to the case where the length was L. So, `min_dist`can be considered as a safe choice for discovering discord of length `L+1`."
