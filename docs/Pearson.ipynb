    "# Pearson Correlation Vs. Z-normalized Euclidean Distance\n",
    "\n",
    "It is [well understood](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.02213.pdf) that the z-normalized Euclidean distance, $ED_{z-norm}$, and the Pearson correlation, $PC$, between any two subsequences with length $m$ share the following relationship:\n",

    "$ED_{z-norm} = \\sqrt {2 * m * (1 - PC)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, when the two subsequences are perfectly correlated (i.e., $PC = 1$), then we get:\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that while $2 * \\sqrt {m}$ (i.e., anti-correlated) is obviously larger than $\\sqrt {2m}$ (i.e., uncorrelated), it is basically impossible for a matrix profile distance to be \"worse\" than uncorrelated (i.e., larger than $\\sqrt {2m}$) due to the fact that it is defined as the distance to its one-nearest-neighbor. For example, given a subsequence `T[i : i + m]`, the matrix profile is supposed to return the z-norm distance to its one-nearest-neighbor. So, even if there existed another z-norm subsequence, `T[j : j + m]`, along the time series that was perfectly anti-correlated with `T[i : i + m]`, then any subsequence that is even slightly shifted away from location `j` must have a smaller distance than $2 * \\sqrt {m}$. Therefore, a perfectly anti-correlated subsequence would/could (almost?) never be a one-nearest-neighbor to `T[i : i + m]` especially if `T` is long."
