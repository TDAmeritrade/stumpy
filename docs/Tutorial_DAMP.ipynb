    "Authors in [DAMP](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/DAMP_long_version.pdf) presented a method for discord detection that is scalable and it can be used in offline and online mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand the mechanism behind this method, we should first understand the difference between the full matrix profile and the left matrix profile of a time series `T`. For a subsequence with length `m`, and the start index `i`, i.e. `S_i = T[i:i+m]`, there are two groups of neighbors, known as left and right neighbors. The left neighbors are the subsequences on the left side of `S_i`, i.e. the subsequences in `T[:i]`. And, the right neighbors are the subsequences on the right side of `S_i`, i.e. the subsequences in `T[i+1:]`. The `i`-th element of the full matrix profile is the minimum distance between `S_i` and all of its neighbors, considering both left and right ones. However, in the left matrix profile, the `i`-th element is the minimum distance between the subsequence `S_i` and its left neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "One can use either the full matrix profile or the left matrix profile to find the top discord, a subsequence whose distance to its nearest neighbor is larger than the distance of any other subsequences to their nearest neighbors. However, using full matrix profile for detecting discords might result in missing the case where there are two rare subsequences that happen to also be similar to each other (a case that is known as \"twin freak\"). On the other hand, the left matrix profile resolves this problem by capturing the discord at its first occurance. Hence, even if there are two or more of such discords, we can still capture the first occurance by using the left matrix profile."

    "The original `DAMP` algorithm needs a parameter called `split_idx`. For a given `split_idx`, the train part is `T[:split_idx]` and the potential anomalies should be coming from `T[split_idx:]`. The value of split_idx is problem dependent. If split_idx is too small, then `T[:split_idx]` may not contain all different kinds of regular patterns. Hence, we may incorrectly select a subsequence as a discord. If split_idx is too large, we may miss a discord if that discord and its nearest neighbor are both in `T[:split_idx]`. The following two extreme scenarios can help with understanding the rationale behind `split_idx`.\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) `split_idx = 0`: In this case, the first subsequence can be a discord itself as it is a \"new\" pattern. <br>\n",
    "(2) `split_idx = len(T) - m` In such case, the last pattern is the only pattern that will be analyzed for the discord. It will be compared against all subsequences except the last one!\n"
